This repository contains the implementation of the core components of the paper: [Mitigating privacy risks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via locally private entity perturbation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306457325000913). In this paper, we introduce LPRAG, a privacy-preserving RAG framework with formal privacy guarantees based on local differential privacy (LDP).ðŸ˜Š
